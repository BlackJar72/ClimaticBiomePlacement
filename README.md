An experiment in placing biome into minecraft using a climate model. 
It grew out of playing around with how to generate maps for procedural 
action RPG settings (which would have included cities, roads, and points 
of interest to build multi-step procedural quests around, had I kept 
on that path with it).  Ultimately, however, it turned into a way to 
simply put biomes into a Minecraft world in a way that made more sense.

Basically, this is what I'd hoped the Minecraft 1.7 update would be
like (and also more-or-less how I assumed biomes worked when I first 
found my second biome in game, but in 1.4.7).  To me this brings back 
a certain fun small world feel, where biome could be big, but you 
didn't have to travel a long way through repetitive repetition of just 
a few similar biomes, something that makes exploring my world much more 
fun.  Besides that, it was an interesting project to work out.
